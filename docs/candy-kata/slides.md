Candy Kata
========

Learning through exercises

### Candy Kata domain
 * A ```Bag``` of randomized instances of type ```Candy```  is generated by invoking ```SchoolGroup.trickOrTreat()```

Candy Kata Test
==========

* **down:** New concepts for Candy Kata Test
* **right:** Candy Kata Test solutions


Top/Bottom Occurrences
---------------
 * Belong to the set of methods of the ```Bag``` interface
 * ```topOccurrences(int count)``` returns the ```count``` most frequently occuring items (e.g. ```topOccurrences(2)``` returns the top 2 most reoccuring items inside the bag).
 * Similarly, ```bottomOccurrences(int count)``` returns the ```count``` least frequently occuring items. 
 * If there is a tie among the items which qualify, the logic is inclusive and will include all items whose occurrences match the occurrences of the last item.
 
Top Occurrences
--------------- 
 ```java
MutableBag<Candy> bag =
  Bags.mutable.with(CRUNCH, HERSHEYS, HERSHEYS, HERSHEYS, MOUNDS, CRUNCH);

MutableSet<Candy> expected = Sets.mutable.with(HERSHEYS, CRUNCH);

Assertions.assertEquals(expected, bag.topOccurrences(2));

bag.add(MOUNDS);
expected.add(MOUNDS);

// The top 2 occurrences actually now includes 3 since there was a tie (CRUNCH and MOUNDS) 
// and the third one's occurrences (MOUNDS) match the last one (CRUNCH)
Assertions.assertEquals(expected, bag.topOccurrences(2));

 ```

Candy Kata Test
----------
 * Fix `CandyKataTest`; there are failing tests.
 * Use topOccurrences()



Candy Kata Test solutions
====================

* **down:** Exercise solutions

Get Top Most Occurred Candy
------------------------------
```java
@Test
public void topCandy()
{
    MutableList<Bag<Candy>> bagsOfCandy = this.collectBagsOfCandy();

    Bag<Candy> bigBagOfCandy =
            bagsOfCandy.flatCollect(bag -> bag).toBag();

    MutableSet<Candy> mostCommon =
            bigBagOfCandy.topOccurrences(1)
                    .collect(ObjectIntPair::getOne)
                    .toSet();

    var expectedSet = Sets.mutable.with(Candy.REESES_PIECES);
    Assert.assertEquals(expectedSet, mostCommon);
}
```

Get Common Candies in Top 10
-------------------------
```java
@Test
public void commonInTop10()
{
    MutableList<Bag<Candy>> bagsOfCandy = this.collectBagsOfCandy();

    MutableSet<Candy> commonInTop10 =
            bagsOfCandy.collect(
                    bag -> bag.topOccurrences(10)
                            .collect(ObjectIntPair::getOne)
                            .toSet())
                    .reduce(MutableSet::intersect)
                    .get();

    var expectedSet = Sets.mutable.with(Candy.REESES_PIECES, Candy.CRUNCH);
    Assert.assertEquals(expectedSet, commonInTop10);
}
```
