Initialize Kata
---------------
Clone this repo or simply download and extract the master [zip file](https://github.com/itohro/eclipse-collections-kata/archive/master.zip), 
then follow the instructions below for your IDE/platform. 


### Eclipse users

Initialize Eclipse project with the command below. 

##### Mac/Linux/Unix:
```
./gradlew eclipse
```

##### Windows:
```
gradlew.bat eclipse
```
Once the project is initialized, 
you can import the project from "Import" => "General" => "Existing Projects into Workspace". 
Select "eclipse-collections-kata" directory as root directory, 
make sure to choose "Search for nested projects" option and finish.
### IntelliJ IDEA users

Initialize IntelliJ IDEA project with the command below. 

##### Mac/Linux/Unix:
```
./gradlew idea
```

##### Windows:
```
gradlew.bat idea
```

Once the project is initialized, 
you can open the project from "File" => "Open..." => choose "eclipse-collections-kata" folder. 
You might see a dialog to suggest importing Gradle project, it's up to you to do so if you'd like to invoke gradle builds from IDEA.
Kata can run in IDEA even if you don't import Gradle project.
